Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and variability
Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for
a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative
(categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the
age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical
variable.
2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,
standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’
of iris.csv dataset.
Provide the codes with outputs and explain everything that you do in this step.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# Load the Iris dataset from seaborn
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Display first few rows
print("First 5 rows of the dataset:")
print(df.head())

# Group by species and calculate summary statistics for sepal_length
summary_stats = df.groupby('species')['sepal_length'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'min', 'max', 'std'])
print("\nSummary statistics of sepal length grouped by species:")
print(summary_stats)

# Create a list of sepal lengths for each species
grouped_lists = df.groupby('species')['sepal_length'].apply(list).to_dict()
print("\nList of sepal lengths for each species:")
for species, lengths in grouped_lists.items():
    print(f"{species}: {lengths[:5]}...")  # Show only first 5 values for brevity









# Filter each species
setosa = df[df['species'] == 'setosa']
versicolor = df[df['species'] == 'versicolor']
virginica = df[df['species'] == 'virginica']

# Function to display descriptive stats
def describe_species(data, name):
    print(f"\nDescriptive statistics for {name}:")
    print(data.describe(percentiles=[.25, .5, .75]))

# Display for each species
describe_species(setosa, 'Setosa')
describe_species(versicolor, 'Versicolor')
describe_species(virginica, 'Virginica')
